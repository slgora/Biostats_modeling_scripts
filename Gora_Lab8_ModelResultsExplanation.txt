The saturated model had a lower chi-square value (0.000) compared to the unsaturated model (0.081). Both models had “good” fitting GFI and RMSEA values with a RMSEA=0.000 and GFI=0.999 in the unsaturated model and a RMSEA=0.000 and GFI=1.000 in the saturated model. The statistical results show that the unsaturated model is comparatively a better model. The saturated model is “overfit” where N-mineralization and CV soil depth (PC2) included in the model as directly affecting species richness makes the model “too saturated”. Soil depth, soil moisture and total N (PC1) is used in the model as a more accurate or perhaps clearer direct predictor affecting species richness without redundancy of additionally including PC2 as a predictor.
